    <!-- Here we're using a new directive, ng-repeat, that will hepl us dynamically create some html parts.
     In this case we're expanding the list that shows the data from our controller's array. We're not only
     controlling the creation of new LI-tags but also their internal state (the hrefs). With Angular
     you can manipulate all elements of a web-page because Angular treats HTML as its "template engine".
     That's why you don't have a separate template engine like Mustache, Handlebars etc.
     HTML is your template engine and not only you can modify the existing one but also you can
     dynamically load parts from other files or from predefined <script>-Areas. -->
