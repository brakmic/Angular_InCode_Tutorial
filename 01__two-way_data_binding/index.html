<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- this is the directive that binds Angular to some part of our web-page (or the web page as a whole).
Theoreticsally one can use any part of the web page to bind the angular runtime to but, please, avoid
the "head" area. It simply makes no sense to bind angular to the invisible part of your web page.
 If unsure, just use <html> to bind to. -->
<html data-ng-app="app">
<head>
    <title>AngularJS</title>
</head>

  <!-- Two-Way Data Binding

Bind a model via data-ng-model directive (or just "ng-model", if you don't care about W3C conformity).
Any changes to this model get reflected in the expression {{ name}}

There's another way to bind a piece of HTML with a variable that prevents "flickering"
of "{{ }}" when the data is not available: "ng-bind"

<label for="name-in">Name: </label>
<input id="name-in" data-ng-model="name"/>
