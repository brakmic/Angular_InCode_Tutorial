Angular In-Code Tutorial
=======================

Learn Angular.js by reading code and comments. No switching between lengthy docs and examples.

There are many excellent books & tutorials, of course. 

But sometimes I just want to take an unknown piece of code, read some initial 
info and simply run it. 

So, here's it: Take any piece of code, run it, read comments, run it again. 

And, please, question everything! Don't trust my code and/or comments. 

The whole bunch is just a result of two days of coding. I wanted to deliver a few examples of some known Angular.js features 
to make internal evaluations in my company a little bit more realistic.

But, beware: I'm not an Angular.js developer. I prefer Backbone.js / Marionette.js. 
Nevertheless, there's no reason to reject any kind of knowledge. You may never know ;) 

I hope these examples will be of some value for you, dear visitor.

If you find any error in code/comments, please, let me know. I'm sure there'll be many of them.
