#Angular In-Code Tutorial

**Learn Angular.js by reading code and comments!** 

*No switching between lengthy docs and code examples.*

There are many excellent books & tutorials, of course. 

But sometimes we just want to take an unknown piece of code, read some initial 
info perhaps,...and simply run it to receive a meaningful result. 

So, here's it: Take any piece of code, open it in your preferred browser, and read the comments. 

*And, please, question everything! Don't trust my code and/or comments.* 

###Why this collection?
This set of code examples is a result of two days of coding at home. I wanted to deliver a few examples of Angular's features 
to make the internal evaluations in my company [ ![Advarics ](http://t58.imgup.net/advarics_le9f7.png "Advarics GmbH") ](http://www.advarics.net "Advarics GmbH") 
more realistic.


###Warning
But, beware: I'm not an Angular.js developer. I prefer Backbone.js / Marionette.js. 

Nevertheless, there's no reason to reject any kind of knowledge. You never know ;) 

I hope these examples will be of some value for you, dear visitor.

If you find any error in code/comments, please, let me know. I'm sure there'll be many of them.
