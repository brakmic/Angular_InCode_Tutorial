    //A directive is actually a "component" that encapsulates logic and styling. It allows us to create reusable pieces
    //of code & styling (html elements) that can change behavior and look of our HTML documents. This pieces can either
    //extend existing HTML elements or provide a completely new ones. One can also define directives as DSL (domain specific
    //languages) because they represent a solution to a certain requirements/expectations or "domains". No language is
    //perfect and therefore every coder will sooner or later try to "find a way" out of the box of his/her current language.
    //Directives are Angular's way of achieving an elegant solution for such kind of problems.

    //A directive has to be defined in a certain way by using predefined Angular constructs.
    //It needs a DDO, Directive Definition Object, which expects a linker function, a template, the controller,
    //the restrictions of a directive and many other options. Actually only the Linker is mandatory but such a directive
    //would be of no value unless you want to deliver some very theoretical representation on how directives work. Therefore,
    //we start with a definition of a two "real" directive that do something. The first one reacts to our mouse clicks and
    //moves an image to the right. The second creates a send-email-form.

    //this directive moves an element (an image for example) to the right when user clicks on it
    function MoveRight(){
        var linker = function($scope, $element, $attrs){ //This is the linker function that "links" the $scope, behavior and styling
                                                        //within the directive. The important fact inside the link function is
                                                        //that Angular's "jQLite" delivers us the actual HTML-Element which we want
                                                        //to use in our directive. Just imagine you have a jQuery object because
                                                        //it is an jQuery object :)

                                                        //to the right.

                          // There's also the option to create a so-called "isolate scope" that will contain only certain

    //level. Just like closures inside JavaScript make possible that inner function retain values of outer function even
    //after they return their own values transclusions allow the same for elements which are located inside other elements.
    //For example:
    //
    //<outer-element ng-controller="OuterCtrl as vm">   --> this controller exposes properties: value1, value2 & value3
    //
    //
    // <inner-element ng-transclude>

    // <div ng-bind="{{ vm.value3 }}"></div>

    // </inner-element> <<--- During the HTML-compilation this element has access to outer-element's controller & its properties,
